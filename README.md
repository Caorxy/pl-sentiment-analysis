**Polish Sentiment Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing different types of language processing and using various methods to analyze the sentiment (negative, neutral, positive) of given Polish text.
The primary aim is to test the performance of different classification models on Allegro reviews (rated 1-5 stars) and evaluate how these models can classify sentiment in examples of texts from popular X (formerly Twitter) accounts.
